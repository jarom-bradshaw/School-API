# Overview

I had never made a API before and during a interview I had for a developer position, they mentioned that they were looking for someone who had experience with API's. I decided to make a API that would allow a user to Get and Post information to a user class. I used Java Springboot. I tried other softwares as well, including node and express, but decided I would use Java Springboot because tehy sent me a message on what the technical interview would be.

I made a simple API and tested it with Postman and programmed student and courses. I mapped their relationship so you can add a student to a school and the courses that student takes. I also made it so you can add one course and the students who take the class. It is tested in Postman.
